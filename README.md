# UpHillChallenge

This project contains the AutoStore application which is part of the UpHill Health code challenge.

To run this application it is only needed to run the deploy-autostore script, which might need execution permissions.
These permission can be attributed with the following command:
chmod +x deploy-autostore

After this, to run the script should be launched with the following command:
sudo ./deploy-backend

The script requires sudo due to docker permissions and to be able to compile the backend application using Maven.
